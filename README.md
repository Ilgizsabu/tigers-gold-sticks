# Tigers-gold-sticks

This project is a game where a player and a computer take turns taking sticks from a pile. At the start, the number of sticks left is told. The player chooses to take 1, 2, or 3 sticks, and then the number of sticks left is updated. Next, the computer takes its turn, also taking 1, 2, or 3 sticks, trying to use the best strategy. The game continues until someone takes the last stick, ending the game.
